Colony Craft:

This program is part of a classroom management “game” that I played with my students. The game included in-person components that allowed students to interact with the material presented by creating an avatar of a person from colonial times. This version is only a demo. To make it more of a full, playable version, the game would first need to start with a “New Game” or “Load Game” option. The New game option would allow students’ names to be input and teams to be created and assigned. The load game option would require the program to allow users to save the data to a file which could be loaded again each day (or for each class period). 

For this version, 6 sample students, split into 3 sample teams are loaded to show functionality. 

Attendance Button:
Clicking the Attendance button will take you to the Attendance Screen. Checking the buttons beside a student’s name will mark that student as “present”, which will award them 20 points to their total once the submit button is clicked. Absent students do not lose points.

Random Event Button:
Clicking the Random Event button will take you to the Random Event Screen where a random even will be populated. Random events are used once daily, often at the start of class. The events correspond to things that could have happened to their avatar. Events apply to either individual students or teams, which are randomly selected. Some events are positive and result in a gain of points and some are negative, resulting in a loss of points. Points lost or gained during the random event are applied to the random student or team that is selected via a generated random number.

Leader Board Button:
The Leader Board Button will take you to the leaderboard where the students’ names and points are presented for view.
